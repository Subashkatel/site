    # Anki for Researchers: Building a Long-Term Knowledge System

    *How I use spaced repetition to retain complex research concepts and build deep understanding over time.*

    > **Note:** This is an AI-generated example post created to demonstrate blog formatting. It is not written by the site author.

    ## The Problem

    As a PhD student, I read dozens of papers every month. The problem? Within weeks, I'd forget most of what I learned. Even important concepts would fade unless I was actively working on them.

    This is where Anki changed everything.

    ## What is Anki?

    [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a spaced repetition system (SRS) - a flashcard app that uses an algorithm to show you cards right before you're about to forget them. It's based on decades of cognitive science research about how memory works.

    ## My System

    Here's how I use Anki for research:

    ### 1. Paper Reading Cards

    When I read a paper, I create cards for:
    - **Key contributions**: What's the main idea?
    - **Technical details**: How does the proposed method work?
    - **Results**: What were the key findings and metrics?
    - **Connections**: How does this relate to other work?

    Example card:
    ```
    Q: What is the main contribution of "Attention Is All You Need"?
    A: Introduced the Transformer architecture, which relies entirely on 
    attention mechanisms without recurrence or convolution, achieving 
    state-of-the-art results on translation tasks.
    ```

    ### 2. Concept Cards

    For fundamental concepts I need to deeply understand:
    ```
    Q: Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms
    A: When two particles become entangled, measuring one instantly 
    affects the other, regardless of distance. The particles share a 
    quantum state until measured.
    ```

    ### 3. Code Snippets

    For implementation details I want to remember:
    ```
    Q: How to implement attention mechanism in PyTorch?
    A: [code snippet with key attention formula]
    ```

    ## Best Practices

    **1. Keep cards atomic** - One concept per card. Don't try to cram too much information.

    **2. Write your own cards** - The act of formulating questions helps you understand. Don't just copy from papers.

    **3. Be consistent** - Review daily. Takes 10-15 minutes for me.

    **4. Connect to context** - Add tags, link related cards, include paper citations.

    ## Results

    After 6 months of consistent use:
    - Retained key concepts from 50+ papers
    - Built intuition for quantum computing fundamentals
    - Can recall important results and methods quickly during discussions
    - Reduced "relearning time" when returning to topics

    ## Tools & Resources

    - [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - The main app (free, open source)
    - [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/) - Sync across devices
    - [Image Occlusion](https://github.com/glutanimate/image-occlusion-enhanced) - For diagram-based learning

    ## Conclusion

    Anki isn't magic - it requires consistency and thoughtful card creation. But for researchers who need to retain large amounts of information across diverse topics, it's invaluable.

    The key insight: **Long-term memory is essential for deep understanding**. You can't make novel connections if you've forgotten the fundamentals.
