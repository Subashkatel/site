    ## About me

    I'm a 4th year undergrad in Computer Science at UC San Diego. During my time here, I have been fortunate enough to work with great mentors - [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hadi/), [Ryan Kastner](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/ryan/), and [Javier Duarte](https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/) - who have shaped my research direction.
    
    <strong>I am currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2025</strong>

    ## My Research

    My research focuses on a key question: 
    
    *How can we make systems more efficient in an era of increasingly complex hardware architectures?*

    I'm currently working with Professor [Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://edge.seas.harvard.edu/team) on developing frameworks to evaluate AI-driven hardware design - an emerging field that's growing rapidly. I'm also building a transpiler to help run PyTorch models on specialized hardware. Iâ€™m also working with Professor Duarte's lab, where we are working toward a foundation model for high energy physics.
