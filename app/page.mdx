    ## About me

    I am a final-year Computer Science student at UCSD. Currently, I am applying to graduate school to explore my passion for compilers, machine learning, and heterogeneous systems.

    ## My Research

    My research interests lies on leveraging compilers and machine learning techniques to optimize heterogeneous systems for high-performance computing environments. II have had the chance to contribute to building compiler tools and techniques that bridge the gap between high-level machine learning models and hardware-specific optimizations.

    In addition to my work in computer science, I have had chance to contribute in high-energy physics, applying self-supervised learning methods to analyze particle jet data. My physics research, under the mentorship of Prof. Javier Duarte, led to the development of the Jet-based Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (J-JEPA), a framework for learning augmentation-independent representations of jets. Still in the works ðŸ˜‰
